We are two random guys, from different walks of life, that happen to make a game together. The game is about making food with an LLM and a diffusion model. This is done by making ingredients that the player can choose by entering any kind of text to give to the LLM that later gives it to the diffusion model.
# LLM and Diffusional model
Stable diffusion - AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI + Stable Diffusion v1.5 model from Hugging Face (Locally ran)

LLM - gemma:2b through Ollama (Locally ran)
